## Abstract


## Objectives


## Outcomes


## Grant Scope


## Project Team
The Helix2 team consists of a single degen developer based out of India (`sshmatrix.eth`), with the possibility of  (`0xc0de4c0ffee.eth`) from Nepal joining the team in Q3 2023. Both are freelance programmers with an extensive skillset and do not count days in hours.

## Background
[`sshmatrix.eth`](https://sshmatrix.eth.limo) is an astrophysicist-turned-programmer with 10+ academic papers and several crypto projects under his belt. [`0xc0de4c0ffee.eth`](https://github.com/0xc0de4c0ffee) has an extensive background in cryptography and has been developing on Bitcoin and Ethereum since almost 10 years.

## Methodology


## Timeline


## Budget
**Amount Requested:** USD 20,000

The costs associated with the grant will be used for primarily three purposes:

- **Principle Developers' Costs**, covering basic cost of living of one developer.
- **DevOps Costs**, covering protocol publicising, on-boarding of [`0xc0de4c0ffee.eth`](https://github.com/0xc0de4c0ffee) to the team.
- **Contract Deployment Costs**, for contract deployments on mainnet; especially expensive due to large codebase of Helix2.
